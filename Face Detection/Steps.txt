EYEBROW - DETECT 
            -> FOR STATIC IMAGES - CHANGE ALL GETTING DETECTED TO ONLY EYEBROW
            
            -> GET VIDEO OF EYEBROW MOVEMENT
            -> EXTRACT KEYFRAMES
            -> COMPARE THEM AND GET CHANGES => GET ALL POINTS THAT CHANGE (Is this the right way to extract motion from still frames?)
            -> GET A FUNCTION THAT SATISFIES ALL THESE POINTS (HOW?)
            -> Replicate this onto the animated imaage
