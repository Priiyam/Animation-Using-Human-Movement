# Animation-Using-Human-Movement

In computer animation, it is very essential to give a human touch to the characters. In this project, we aim to develop an application where objects (or characters) can be animated by recording and observing the corresponding human movement. For instance, waving a hand can be recorded and an animated hand should move the same way. The whole motion (for instance ­ raising eyebrows) can be divided into keyframes and the parts of the object to be animated can be made to move to match the position in these key frames. The transition between these keyframes can be mapped to a function depending on the type of motion. For developing this application, we will first concentrate on 2 movements ­
  1. Waving a hand
  2. Raising eyebrows
# Inputs: 
  The input is human movement and it will be captured using a camera (or kinect). The movement can also be given as a series of images which demonstrate movement (gradual change in the position of the object), also known as a time lapse.
# Outputs: 
  The output will be similar movement expressed by a virtual object (to be animated). Initially identifying the changes in the position is to be achieved, following which the transition between the changes should be mapped onto a function and finally, the movement should be expressed by the virtual object.
# Performance measurement criteria: 
  Performance can be determined by measuring the accuracy with which the motion is replicated.
